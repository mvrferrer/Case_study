I think they need to create a stigma, marketing, a rouse, with assisting small business owners.
(This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

I think almost the heyday, of giant corporations, are already situation and loyal to their banks. Small business, new, smaller sized companies are a threat.

OCR, Optical character recognition for checks. 
 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Last but not least, I am certain Marcus and Goldman Sachs will follow suite to compete with JP Morgan’s latest news, having its own cryptocurrency.
